Bank Management System in C

This project is a console-based Bank Management System developed in the C programming language. It enables users to perform essential banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transaction history viewing, and interest calculation. The system uses structures and file handling to store and manage account data securely. A menu-driven interface makes navigation simple, and an admin login system ensures authorized access.
